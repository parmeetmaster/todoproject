# Todo App

A simple and efficient Todo App built with **Riverpod** for state management. This app is designed to help you manage your tasks effectively, allowing you to:

- Add a new task with a title and a checkbox to mark it as complete.
- Display a list of tasks, showing their titles and completion status.
- Mark tasks as complete by checking the checkbox.

For small projects, I prefer using **Riverpod** due to its simplicity and flexibility. However, I can also create similar projects using **BLoC with Clean Architecture** for larger, more complex applications.

## Features

1. **Add Tasks**:
    - Enter a task title and add it to the list.

2. **View Tasks**:
    - View all tasks in a categorized list of active and completed tasks.

3. **Task Completion**:
    - Mark tasks as complete or move them back to active status using the checkbox.
